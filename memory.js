// Stack(Primitive) , Heap(Non-Primitive

// Stack: It is a data structure used to store static data. 
// Static data refers to data whose size is known by the engine during compile time.
//  In JavaScript, static data includes primitive values like strings, numbers, boolean, null, and undefined.
//  References that point to objects and functions are also included. 
// A fixed amount of memory is allocated for static data. 
// This process is known as static memory allocation.
// Heap: It is used to store objects and functions in JavaScript.
//  The engine doesnâ€™t allocate a fixed amount of memory.
//  Instead, it allocates more space as required.
